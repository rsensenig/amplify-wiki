# Types of Users

**Constituent**: Our main bases of end users of this platform are constituents found across the United States. They are motivated by convenience, updates, and their role within their community.  

**Advocacy Groups**: Groups looking to make it easy for their requests for change to be understood, looking at data of how users are interacting with issues.
